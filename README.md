# Toolbox_LFP_Spike
preprocessing/analyzing electrophysiology signals

This toolbox contains the scripts which are used for preprocessing/analyzing electrophysiology signals of local field potentials (LFP) and spikes. These codes can be run by matlab (Matlab R2016a) on Windows 10. You can find a file named ‘User_Manual.m’ containing all the functions within this toolbox. Meanwhile, within each folder, you can find a ‘User_Example.m’ file for how to use the code for individual analysis. 

The toolbox also contains a folder for Klusta spike sorting (…\Spike_analysis\mfiles). For the detailed information about Klusta, you can check: https://klusta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sorting/

To run all the codes, you need about 30min.
