# Toolbox_LFP_Spike
preprocessing/analyzing electrophysiology signals

This toolbox contains the scripts which are used for preprocessing/analyzing electrophysiology signals of local field potentials (LFP) and spikes. These scripts can be run by matlab (Matlab R2016a) on Windows 10. The file named ‘User_Manual.m’ describes all the functions within the toolbox. Meanwhile, each folder contains a ‘User_Example.m’ file which explains how to use the code for individual analysis. 
The toolbox also contains a folder for Klusta spike sorting (…\Spike_analysis\mfiles). For detailed information on Klusta, please check: https://klusta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sorting/

Running all the scripts takes about 30 min.
