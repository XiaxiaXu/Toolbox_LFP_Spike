% by Mattia. creates the lynux script that you can use to run clustering on
% all your files.

% INPUT:
%   animals      - see main script, you can easily rewrite it with
%                  experiments if this suits better your needs
%   BATfolder    - string, where you will find the BAT file (lynux script)
%   PRMfolder    - string, the main folder in which you store PRM files

% IMPORTANT: change the str2 line to the directory in which you have saved
% THE installation files of Anaconda.

% When this has run, you will find a BAT file that you simply need to
% double click to start the clustering process.
